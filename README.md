# NeXTStack — Week 1 Day 2: Bio Page

## What I built
A semantic HTML bio page with headings, sections, lists, links, and a profile image.

## How to run it
Open `index.html` in a web browser.

## What I learned
- Semantic tags make code readable.
- File paths must match folders and names exactly.

## What was challenging
- My image didn’t show until I fixed the filename/path.

## Next improvement
- Add CSS styling in Week 2.
